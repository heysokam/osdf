# Unreleased
2022.08.04
```
fix : Fixed a buildsystem bug. After changing to SCons nodes, the engine wasn't being built
```
... :  

# History
## 0.3.0
_v0.3.0-r0_  

2022.07.18  
```
new : Initial accel hud code has been added to the buildsystem. Currently inactive (WIP)  
```

2022.07.15  
```
new : (VJK) New Mechanic: Jump Holdboost  
   ::  While holding jump, and moving at +375ups, you get extra jumpvel on each jump (375 is 1.5x of 250basespeed)  
   ::  It will reach the same heigh than vq3 in 8jumps, but will keep growing  
   ::  Starts at 225 base jumpvel, and increases by 5u each jump  
   ::  5u is 12% of 45. Which is the difference between vq3 and vjk jumpvel (270-225)  
new : (VJK) HoldBoost hud element  
```

2022.07.14  
```
new : Sound event control system in cg_event.c  Can be used to stop any type of sound spam (autojump, rampslides, etc)  
new : (CQ3) New physics: VQ3 aircontrol, with CPM tech (dj/ramps/slick/etc)  
```

2022.07.13  
```
new : pm_time hud element   (mainly related to skimming, but general purpose)  
```
```
new : New mechanic: Rampslides from Q2  (currently active for VQ4 physics)  
chg : (VQ1) Added Q3 Overbounces  
fix : (VQ1) Fixed visual glitch on physics change without `/map` command  
fix : (VQ1) Fixed downramps sometimes not giving a speed boost
new : (VQ1) New mechanic: Feetraise
... :       Crouching mid-air raises your feet by 14u (sbj). Allows jump to reach higher and further.  
new : (VQ4) Crouching mid-air raises your feet by 12u (sbj). Allows jump to reach higher and further.  
```

2022.07.12  
```
fix : (VQ3) Fixed upramps giving the wrong amount of velocity on jump  
chg : (VJK) Reverted jumpvel back to 225 (in preparation for a new jump height mechanic)  
```
```
new : (VQ4) New physics : Quake 4 Inspired.  Activate with `/exec phy_vq4`  
   ::       Will have crouchsliding, rampslides (from q2/q4) and vq3 aircontrol  
new : (VQ4) Set groundaccel to 15 (same as original Q4 and cpm)  
new : (VQ4) New mechanic: Crouchslide  
   ::       Earns 2x frames of crouchslide per 1x frame spent in the air, capped at 2000ms   
   ::       Has 0 friction, and a separate accel value of 20  (could change after testing)  
```

## 0.2.0
2022.06.21  
_v0.2.0-r0_  
```
new : OBfix. Applied on SURF_NOOB surfaces (cvar to be done)
chg : bg_pmove restructure. Moved all custom code to phy/ subfolder
```

2022.06.20
```
new : Initial work on Strafehud porting. Not connected, but doesn't break compiling
chg : (VJK) Changed jumpvel from 225 to default vq3 (270), to allow easier clearing of defrag maps
```
```
fix : (Q1) "Stepdown" bug is fixed (wasn't stepdown, it was q1 downramp behavior happening on incorrect dotproduct)
fix : (Q1) W/S movement working properly in q1 physics  
fix : (Q1) Crouch works again in q1 physics  
fix : (Q1) Surf ramps no longer stick you to the ramp on exit
new : (Q1) Variable Jump Heights. Activated with +speed. 
... :      Flatground = x0.5 jumpvel
... :      Downramps behave like q1 (additive, based on your current Zvel)
... : (code) VectorReflectOS. Sets backoff = 0 when facing away from the surface
```

2022.06.18  
```
chg : CPM Item Pickup: Above size increased from 36u (32u doesn't trigger) to 66 (62u doesn't trigger)  
new : VJK physics. VQ3 with 4airaccel, 12groundspeed, 250speed and 225jumpvel. `/exec phy_vjk`  
```
```
chg : Moved all custom bg_pmove.c code into subfolder sgame/phy/  (not connected to the buildsystem yet)   
new : Added basic buildsystem instructions (sketch)  
... : Added Native windows build instructions for the `chocolatey/mingw` method  
... : Added disclaimer for WSL cross-compilation  
new : Initial edits to the buildsystem for native windows compilation  
... : Fixed native win32 SCons environment resolution  
... : Changed file path resolution, so that it remains system-agnostic (uses SCons Nodes wherever possible)  
```

2022.06.11
```
fix : CPM Rocket Launcher: Vertical self knockback scaling reduced to 1  
```

2022.06.10  
_v0.2.0-r0_  
```
new : (cfg) VM configuration disables QVM loading (vm_cgame 0, vm_game 0, vm_ui 0)  
new : (cfg) Server Pure is deactivated, to allow Library Loading (sv_pure 0)  
new : Buildsystem ported to SCons. No longer uses make  
... : Buildsystem handles Cross-Compiling for both win/lnx  
... : Libraries are not packed in a .pk3 (they don't work from inside one)  
... : Buildscript creates and zips both platform binaries  
new : Custom fork of oDFe. Loads osdf mod directly
rmv : Removed bash shell script for launching the mod (was system dependent)  
```
```
chg : CPM Rocket Launcher: Self knockback increased to 1.2  
fix : /cpm and /vq3 commands now work with osdf
```

2022.05.10  
```
rmv : Removed bash shell script used for automating the build process. Temporarily stored in `+` subfolder, but will be deleted.
new : Linux automated build script has been fully rewritten in nimscript (bash becomes {cr}ypt!$C real fast)  
chg : The build system no longer compiles into QVM by default. It creates Dynamic Libraries instead.  
dep : This mod will no longer support the QVM architecture moving forward. Incoming features will make the mod fully incompatible with QVM compilation  
```

## 0.0.2
```
new : Local Timer. Best per session. All maps have TimeReset (temporary hack until better Timer support)  
new : target_startTimer entity support  
new : target_stopTimer entity support  
```
```
new : Full cpm strafing (double jumps, slick haste, telejumps, stairjumps, rampjumps, etc)  
new : CPM weapon behavior  
... : Instant weapon switch on CPM  
... : Rocket Launcher speed increased from 900 to 1000  
chg : Q1-qw deactivated. Q1 physics default to AG-style  
new : Q1 AD movement, balanced similarly to QW (77fps/32as/100aa)  
new : Q1 AD movement, balanced similarly to AG (125fps/35as/100aa)  
new : Physics type Selection (phy_movetype NUMBER :: 0=CPM, 3=VQ3, 1:Q1-ag)  
```
```
new : Initial Main Menu UI layout, background and theme
```

## 0.0.1
```
new : Basic cpm strafing (Correct accel, aircontrol and A/D strafing)  
new : Instant respawn:  
... : Respawn minimum delay changed from 1700 to 0 on player_die()
... : g_forcerespawn now means miliseconds, instead of seconds  
... : g_forcerespawn default value changed to 1. Previous behavior is now `g_forcerespawn 20000`  
chg : Powerups no longer drop on player_die()  (sk->wrn : date/version might be wrong)
chg : Score is now set to 0 on player_die()
... : New function SetScore() on g_combat.c. Modified version of AddScore()
new : Gamemode "run" (basic). Replaces FFA, `g_gametype 0`  
chg : Changed default pmove_fixed value to 1. It doesn't need to be changed by cfg to work correctly.  
new : Created default .cfg files. Solves pmove_fixed not being used automatically, and some other configuration basics.  
```
```
new : Basic Linux automatic qvm compiling setup. Script at: src/qvm.sh  
... : Automated compilation from makefile  
... : Automated packing  
```

## 0.0.0 (Mod Compiling Basics)

: Vq3 Weapons  
: Vq3 Teleports  
: vq3 Hurt Trigger
