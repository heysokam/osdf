### Contribute
Contributions to this project are welcome.  
Open an issue with your idea, or contact me in some other way, and we will discuss about it.  
Just know that this project has a very clear vision/direction, and ideas will be filtered very strongly because of that.  

### Alternatives
If you don't like that, and prefer a more community-developed mod, you should take a look at [Opensource Defrag](github.com/heysokam/osdf) instead.
But if you can't use SDK licensing, and prefer a fully GPL mod to start your project with, then you should fork this repository.
